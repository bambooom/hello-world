## Preparation

- [Install Rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/)
- [Install rust-analyzer extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
- [Install workshop runner `wr` to help to verify your solutions](https://mainmatter.github.io/rust-workshop-runner/)

I'm on MacOS, so I just use the following command to install Rust:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Rust is installed and managed by the `rustup` tool.

Use `rustup update` to update Rust installation.
Use `rustup self uninstall` to uninstall Rust.
Use `rustc --version` to check installed Rust version.
